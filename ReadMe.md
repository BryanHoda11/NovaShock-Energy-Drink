## Pointers about the Project :-

```
1. This is no exact clone of any webpage. I just gathered ideas from few and created my own energy drink website named NovaShock!
```

```
2. No disrespect to any brands here. Everything made is just for pure learning experience and improving my personal skills.
```
```
3. After referring to few energy drink websites I copied few designs but also there are some of my own designs. Mixture of both you know... I do not prefer complete cloning!
```
```
4. The ambassadors I have also used just big personalities to add little realism in the project and not make it fully practical. Added two big sports persnalities!
```
```
5. The default normal styling is done using Tailwind and the responsive styles are done through the normal Media Queries as I was a bit confused with Tailwind Breakpoints. Plus both Tailwind CSS & Vanilla CSS gets practiced and nothing gets left behind.
```
```
6. I made only 2 pages responsive as the files were getting more and the browser was hanging as well. Made my first proper frontend website of a hypothecial Energy Drink company. I enjoyed thoroughly making this project :)
